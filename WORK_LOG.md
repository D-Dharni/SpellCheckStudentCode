I knew that bubble sort would be too slow and that's because you move through the dictionary to check for the word. So instead, what if you could look up the words in constant time. That's when I thought about what if you could take each word in the dictionary and just have a value for each word individually. The issue is figuring out a way where you can actually give each word a specific integer value. I thought about maybe just multiplying adding up the ASCII values for the words but I realized that words like act and cat would have the same value even though they are different words. I started to think about how I could leverage the ASCII value to create a formula that was unique to each character. |

I saw that I was trying to find a formula for each character that leveraged the ASCII value of the character. I saw in the previous work-log that I was thinking about adding the ASCII values but for example act and cat would be the same. So I started to think about how the position of each character could affect each word. If an a in the first character had a different effect than the one at the second character that could create a different value. For cat, you could have the first as a weight of 0, then 1, then 2 for example. Using that logic I made this formula. For each character in the word you say value = (value * 29) + ASCII value. Let's go step by step. I picked 29 because it's a medium sized prime number that will scramble the letters pretty effectively compared to a smaller or non-prime number. For cat you would say (0*29) + 99 for 'c' then (99*29)+97 for 'a' and finally (2968*29) + 116 for 't.' This mixes up the values for each word pretty well I don't think that it is 100% perfect but it does a pretty good job of creating a unique word value. |
| September 27 |   3-4:00    | I went back to thinking about the formula and how it could be applied and realized that the formula only really solved one problem of the actual code. The whole point of the formula would be to assign each word and individual unique value to look it up to. So I split the code into two parts. The first would be to build the dictionary structure for the constant look-ups. I looked back at my formula and made one important adjustment to it. If I thought about my problem as a giant library, each library had shelves and each shelf had books on it. In our scenario each book is the word and the shelves are the way they are arranged. Because the values for the words would be so big I have to figure out a way to put each of those words into the dictionary. To put each book into the shelf, if each word did in fact have a unique value then you would need at least 150,000 shelf if there was only one book per shelf. Each shelf has an arraylist of books because they could have 0, 1, 2, 3, we don't know how many books. Therefore if you took the value the formula gave you and used modulo to it for the size of the number of shelves it would bring it back into range to store it into the shelf. So to populate our structure you would loop through each word in the dictionary calculate its unique value, then use the modulo to figure out the index of the word and add the word to the proper index in our structure. The second part was way easier to think about. For each word in the text, you find the word's value and use the modulo. Then you search the shelf at that index using either bubble sort or just regular I'm not sure yet which one but I think regular might be faster since because of the way the structure was set-up there should not be more than like 3 for each shelf. If it's not in the shelf then you just add it to an array of misspelled words. After I figured this out I went into my actual spellCheck code and wrote out the pseudocode for the framework. |

It was fairly easy because I had thought through the code pretty well. I didn't run into any issues besides the part about checking the misspelled words. I realized that I hadn't come up with a very efficient way for checking whether there were duplicate words and because of that I had to loop through the misspelled words linearly every time which took super long. This made it so that some of the checks worked but the ones like Bard and Rome timed out. I think I might need to implement something around constant time map look-ups for that to make it more efficient. |

First, I reviewed the slides and re-did the worksheet we did from class to make sure I understood how the TST actually works. Then, I figured out what I would need from each class. From the node I decided to store the character, it's child, and whether or not it was the terminal node. For the TST I thought it would be important to have a contains function and an inserting word function for use. I was going to make a bunch of instance variables for my node class but then I realized that I'm only ever using the class in that one section of my code and therefore it would be a waste of coding space. So I simply set up those instance variables. I realized that the contains and insert functions would be super similar to each other because to implement them you could just use recursive DFS. I made a helper function for each of them to keep my code abstracted. Inside the function the basic formula would be to check if the current character of the node was > < or = to the character of the word you are looking at. If it's < or > than then you would recursively loop through those next sections of the TST. If it was = then you would check if it is the last character in the word because if it is that's the terminal node or you would just keep looping through the middle and move on to searching for the next character. I'm guessing that now that this is finished the rest of the actual code should be easier so I decided it would be a good point to stop at since I was getting tired of coding. |

It was nice to finish it up because I had already created all the functions I needed for my code to work. I did the insert word function to put every word in the dictionary and then looped through each word in the text and used the check word function to decide whether it needed to be added to the TST. Finally, you just had to return the list converted to an array format. |

I started to work on the trie implementation just very basic outline of the functions I would want. Most of the time was spent rearranging my code. |

So first off, I finished my trie class by making the insert and check word functions which were much easier than the TST implementations. Instead of doing it recursively, you could just loop straight down through the middle and keep checking to make sure it had a parent. Then, I tried to figure out how to actually run it in spell check which took me a while and I realized I could just use one implementation with a TST for the dictionary and misspelled words and another with the Trie for both. All of the sudden, my code started failing everytime. I separated my one node class into two but still, for some reason, my TST class just won't be able to run anymore at the same rate. It is super frustrating and I can't figure out why. Also my Trie class doesn't run for the test cases even after trying to reduce the alphabet size, or putting null barriers. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong and am going to need to go in during tutorial to figure it out. |

I went through my google docs closed all of the tabs I didn't need, exited all the applications I didn't need and my code started passing every test just fine. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
